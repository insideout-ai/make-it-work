# Implement feedback evals

These cases resume a seeded `implement` run at `final-sync`, allowing the terminal feedback hook to be exercised without replaying refinement, planning, execution, and review.

- `feedback-clean` verifies the compact entry for a minimal completed run.
- `feedback-nonminimal` verifies Audit-log-based counting, retrospective analysis, skill attribution, share-safe output, and subagent dispatch after counters have reset.
- `feedback-idempotent` verifies replacement of the matching run block while preserving older runs and user-authored text.

The deterministic feedback writer has local fixture-backed tests for the same
counting, formatting, and preservation rules. Run them without model calls:

```sh
node --test skills/implement/scripts/write-feedback.test.mjs
```

The model-driven cases remain useful for verifying that `implement` invokes
the writer at the right terminal point and uses an independent retrospective
agent for non-minimal runs.

Run all cases from the repository root:

```sh
bash evals/implement/run-all.sh
```

Each fixture script refuses to seed an existing Git repository. The cases require Bash because `implement` validates Git state and records real timestamps, and Agent because non-minimal feedback is deliberately analyzed in a fresh subagent.

Loop-limit stops and post-terminal clarification are also covered by the skill's explicit eligibility and ordering contract. They remain manual scenarios because producing those states end-to-end requires replaying the capped review/fix loops rather than safely resuming a deterministic terminal fixture.
